# Dijkstra-Algorithm
Dijkstra Algorithm for finding shortest path

Heap-based implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm. I am open to suggestions for any improvements in the code. :)

MAIN CODE: Dijkstra_heap.py

TEST CASES: dijkstraData.txt (undirected graph of 200 nodes)
            
            dijkstraTest1.txt (undirected graph of 8 nodes)
            
            dijkstraTest2.txt (undirected graph of 5 nodes)
